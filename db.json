At the time, the band's name was written as The Red Hot Chili Peppers, just like the name of the album. Most of the songs were written in 1983 with founding members Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons, and earlier versions of these songs appeared on the band's 1983 Demo. They decided to leave the band and Anthony Kiedis and Flea ended up hiring Jack Sherman and Cliff Martinez to record the entire album. They wrote a few more songs together and toured with them after the album was released.",

Due to Anthony Kiedis relapsing on and off the albums tone and mood seems to be yoyo'd between rock and punk rock resulting in a poor follow-up to the previous almums success.",
